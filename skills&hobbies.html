        <b>1.<u>Coding with C:-</u></b><br>
		C coding skills refer to the ability to write, understand, and debug programs written in the C programming language. This includes a strong grasp of concepts such as variables, data types, control structures (if, loops), functions, arrays, pointers, memory management, and file handling. Skilled C programmers can efficiently solve problems, optimize code for performance, and manage low-level operations. C coding skills are fundamental for systems programming, embedded systems, and software development where performance and hardware control are critical.

	   <b>2.<u>Coding with C++:-</u></b><br>
	   C++ coding skills involve the ability to write and understand programs using C++, an object-oriented extension of the C language. Key skills include knowledge of classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, templates, and the Standard Template Library (STL). A proficient C++ programmer can design modular, reusable, and efficient code, often used in game development, system/software engineering, and performance-critical applications. Mastery of C++ also includes memory management, exception handling, and understanding of both low-level and high-level programming features.

	   <b>3.<u>Coding with Python:-</u></b><br>
	   Python coding skills refer to the ability to write clear, efficient, and readable code using the Python programming language. Key skills include understanding data types, control structures, functions, modules, and exception handling. Proficiency in Python also involves using libraries and frameworks like NumPy, Pandas, Flask, or Django, depending on the application area. Python is widely used in web development, data analysis, automation, machine learning, and scripting. Its simplicity and versatility make strong Python coding skills valuable for both beginners and experienced developers.

	   <b>4.<u>DBMS using MYSQL:-</u></b><br>
	   DBMS (Database Management System) skills involve the ability to design, manage, and interact with databases efficiently. Key skills include writing SQL queries, understanding database models (relational, hierarchical, NoSQL), performing CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete), and ensuring data integrity and security. Proficiency in DBMS also includes knowledge of normalization, indexing, transactions, and backup strategies. These skills are essential for roles in data management, software development, and business intelligence.
	  </font> </td></tr><tr><td align="justify"><font size="5">
	   <b>5.<u>Web Design:-</u></b><br>
	   Web design using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP involves creating dynamic, interactive, and responsive websites. HTML structures the content, CSS styles it for visual appeal, JavaScript adds interactivity, and PHP handles server-side processing. Together, these technologies enable the development of full-featured websites with both front-end and back-end functionality. Key skills include form handling, responsive layouts, DOM manipulation, and connecting to databases using PHP. Mastery of these tools is essential for building modern, user-friendly web applications.
	   </font></td></tr><tr><td align="justify"><font size="5">
	   <b>6.<u>Arduino Projects:-</u></b><br>
	   Arduino project skills involve designing and building electronic projects using the Arduino microcontroller platform. Key skills include programming in Arduinoâ€™s C/C++-based language, working with sensors, actuators, and other hardware components, and understanding circuit design and wiring. These skills enable the creation of interactive devices, prototypes, and automation systems. Proficiency also includes troubleshooting, integrating communication modules, and using development environments like the Arduino IDE. Arduino skills are valuable for robotics, IoT, and embedded systems projects.
